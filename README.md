#Assignment: 

   With the support of the Apache POI Maven dependency, data was successfully extracted from an Excel spreadsheet. In the first case, a HashMap was employed to store entry and exit times, mapped to corresponding individuals, enabling the identification of those who worked for seven consecutive days. In the second case, the time difference between entry and exit times was calculated, specifically focusing on individuals who worked for durations greater than 1 hour and less than 10 hours. Finally, in the third case, individuals logging more than 14 hours of work were isolated using the same HashMap.

   This approach facilitated a detailed analysis of work patterns and durations for effective workforce management.
